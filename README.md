**Introduction**
_____________________________________________________________________________
Writing a thousand lines of code and turning that into a website is one of the creative and complicated things for web developers. If you get excited seeing a lot of beautiful web sites and thinking to try your hands on it then we need to open your eyes telling some important things that you should know as a web developer. 

Creating a website that gets a lot of users attention is not just about learning various programming languages, you also need to learn some other concepts like Dev Tools, data formats, testing, APIs, authentication and a lot of stuff like that once you will dig yourself into thisfield. The most important skill or knowledge every developer should lea rn first is thesethree basic building blocks i.e. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We will be using HTML and CSS in frontend for interfaces. Just right click on our web browser and then selecting view page source option does it. 

We can find the structure of your website where a lot of HTML tags are used for different purposes.CSS is also used in the frontend that decides the style, design, layout and how HTML elements need to be displayed on the screen. Java script is high in demand nowadays and it is basically responsible for making our HTML pages dynamic and interactive. Java script also comes with a variety of languages like to make our website more interactive. If we’re gonna specialize in java script like MEAN Stack then we’re gonna deep dive into this language because this one will be our front end as well as backend language. You can do a lot of stuff using browser Dev Tools like debugging, editing HTML elements, editing CSS properties, checking device, tracking java script error, etc. Every developer should be aware of using different tabs (elements, console, 
network, etc.) in Dev Tools to make their work easier and faster.
